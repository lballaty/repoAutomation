## Why Consolidated?

RepoTools and repoAutomation had similar purposes (repository tooling). They have been consolidated into a single private repository to:
- Eliminate duplication
- Centralize all repository tools
- Improve organization and documentation
- Better security management
- Add new security scanning capabilities

## Security Note

This repository had its git history cleaned on 2025-10-17 to remove:
- Exposed GitHub token (now revoked)
- `.github_token` file
- Other sensitive data

The cleaned version is safe to use, but all active development has moved to privateRepoTools.

## Archive Date

**Consolidated:** 2025-10-17

**This repository is now archived and will not receive updates.**
